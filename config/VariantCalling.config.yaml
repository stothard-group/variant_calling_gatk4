# This value is 100 for data generated on non-arrayed flowcells (ie from GAIIx, HiSeq1500/2000/2500), or 2500 for arrayed flowcell data (eg HiSeqX, HiSeq3000/4000, NovaSeq). Note these are all Illumina instruments, if you have data from other instruments you must work with the supplier to determine this value.
